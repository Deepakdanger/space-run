You are in a differnet planet, you have no idea what is awaiting you. Your instincts tell you that collecting those gems might prove to be difficult. So you have decided to bring your trusty revolver laser gun. Press `Space key` to shoot. Other than the obvious laser, there is also an animation whenever you fire.
Life is not that easy though. You can only fire `6 laser shots` before your gun is empty.An empty gun looks different. It looks, well, empty.

##### Empty gun
